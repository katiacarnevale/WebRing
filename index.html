        <p> At this time in their lives they have been quite close, sharing this studio has provided them with a lot of quality time together. Although some days the silence fills the studio even more than their supplies and artwork, their relationship is mutually understood. He’s rough around the edges and has a short temper when it comes to any form of confrontation. She therefore has struggled to express her desire to have a stable relationship with her brother. </p>

      <h1> There is a lot to accomplish today, so the past events of the day had to be pushed behind them. The two of them were constantly busy with their own individual projects. He worked mostly in sculpture and was often tearing things apart and building it all up again in different formations. She has a deep love and talent for color; water color, painting and a canvas were the premise of most of her projects. They never thought to nor would have ever believed they would receive a request for a piece done in partnership with one another. When they received the order they were both shocked, excited and apprehensive. Why and how would anyone want a collaboration of their contradicting styles? Did another take into account the difference in brains and souls of the two individuals they are dealing with?  Despite their lack of confidence in their combination, this project would be foolish to turn down. The opportunity the project presented for both of their names was transformative.

      <h1> They met at the door and proceeded to walk into the studio. When they walked in the two glanced around the room and acknowledged the two separated spaces before them.  The divide seemed harsh and caused a sense of sadness to take over the both of them. With a confident stride her brother moved towards his side of the room. Confused and concerned she took to hers and began picking up some brushes to rinse off. On the way over to the sink her brother met her halfway, extending a hand in front of her. She looked down at it confused, then back up at his eyes. He grinned, taking some of the brushes out of her hand.
